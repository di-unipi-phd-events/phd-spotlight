The first edition of **PhD Spotlight – From Study to Research**, will be held on *Monday 11 November 2024, 14:00 – 16:30*, in the corridor in front of the *Seminar Rooms* (in the Department of Computer Science).

👨🏻‍💻👩🏼‍💻 The event consists of a poster session aimed at introducing MSc students to the research carried out by PhD students. 
These could become starting points for future dissertations or, perhaps, encourage them to continue their academic career with a PhD.

☕️ In addition, we will provide a free coffee break, kindly offered by the PhD Programme.
