"Traditional Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are valuable for securely managing digital assets, uniquely identifying them, and enabling ownership transfer. However, NFTs cannot represent mutable assets - those whose characteristics evolve over time - without compromising uniqueness. This research introduces Non-Fungible Mutable Tokens (NMTs), which address this limitation by enabling asset attribute updates - NMTs support lifecycle changes to asset attributes while maintaining uniqueness and security, implementing access control - using an XACML base Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model.  NMTs regulate operations such as minting, ownership transfer, and updates.
