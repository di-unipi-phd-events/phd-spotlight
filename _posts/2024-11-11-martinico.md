Similarity Search is a key search paradigm in our era. Large language models allows us to produce vectors representing data. 
Nearest Neighbors Search aims to efficiently and effectively query these vectors using simple similarity measures.
Interested research areas include LLMs,  kNN search  and models and vectors compression.
