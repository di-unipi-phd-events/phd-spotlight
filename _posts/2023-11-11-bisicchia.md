Quantum Computing, from a dream of a physicist, is now becoming a reality and promises to revolutionise the world. But, to best exploit the full potential of Quantum Computers, the development of a full discipline of Quantum Software Engineering is needed. Some authors claim that Quantum Computing will lead to a new "Golden Age" of Software Engineering. The field, however, is still in its infancy and various research questions and unexplored directions are still open.
