ECLYPSE is a versatile Python-based platform designed for simulating and emulating complex Edge-Cloud environments, addressing key challenges in distributed computing, including resource management, service placement, and network variability. Unlike traditional simulation-only tools, ECLYPSE enables developers to run realistic emulations of actual application implementations, allowing for highly accurate testing under near-real-world conditions. 

With its modular architecture, ECLYPSE supports customizable deployment strategies, adaptive workload management, and event-driven updates - ideal for applications in smart cities, IoT, and real-time analytics. 
Through Pythonâ€™s extensive library ecosystem, ECLYPSE provides flexible integration with various backends, making it a powerful tool for advancing Edge-Cloud research and practical deployments.

Future directions include enhanced network transmission logging, benchmark factories, and infrastructure characterization for mobility, energy-awareness, and operational cost modeling.
