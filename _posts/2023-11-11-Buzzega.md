In this poster we discuss the concept of inclusion-maximal subsequences of a set of strings. Subsequences do not have to be contiguous.
Even though this concept is simple to explain, finding all maximal common subsequences hides some interesting challenges.
We will see some pitfalls and some solution to this fun problem on strings.
