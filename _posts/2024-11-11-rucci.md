We explore key challenges in graph problems, focusing on solutions using decentralized algorithms. We present the methodology to be used for developing such algorithms, allowing scalable, efficient processing even in large and dynamic graphs.
Examples include routing optimization in telecommunications, sensor network coordination, and social network analysis, where decentralized approaches can improve performance and resilience.
